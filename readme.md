# Go App

Learning Golang whilst building a simple web application.
This simple app demonstrates routing, templating and file structure.

## Running the app

After installing Golang, run the following:

```bash
cd src
```

```golang
go run main.go
```

To build the application, run the following:

```golang
go build -o build/app main.go
```

This will create an executable file named app in the build folder, 
Which you can run with the following:

```bash
./build/app
```
